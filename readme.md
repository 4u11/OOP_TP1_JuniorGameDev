Identity: Redacted


Plot: This story i've taken inspiration from the famous RPG game from Besthesda Softworks, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (i recommend you to play it. It's peak). The story is set in a fantasy world where magic can happen~ huhu so cool. This story takes places in alternate universe where the main character (In the real game it's not exactly the main character, but you get the point) is a Vampire as in Dawnguard DLC, the character was named Serana, that is the daughter from ColdHarbour Family. Her mother name is Valerica and her father is Lord Hakon. The story takes place before Serana was found by the Dragonborn (the main character in the real game). (Btw, Serana is the unholic goth mommy Vampire, that i want her to--) ehum, so that's the introductory. 

Scene to another scence explanation: so the first major storyline is when Serana before become the vampire a normal life in castle Volkihar, second is when her family and Serana was turned into vampire before her father knew the prophecy of tyranny of the sun, third is when Serana was moving out from her original place.
